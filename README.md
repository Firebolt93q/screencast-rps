## Episode 1

We will setup a single-module C program roughly based on [this implementation](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors#C). Qt Creator will be the IDE to help us build and debug this program. We will learn a lot about pointers in the process, it will be fun.

- See [the Python example above][impl] for an end-user result.
