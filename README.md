## Episode 3

Now that we know pointers, it's about time to understand how `char*` strings work in C. And as the program will grow a little more complex, we will think about ways to split up our code into multiple files and what that means for the compiler and linker.

## Episode 2

In the second episode we learn what pointers are, and how to use them correctly. This will be a major achievement for everyone set out to learn C or C++.

## Episode 1

We will setup a single-module C program roughly based on [this implementation](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors#C). Qt Creator will be the IDE to help us build and debug this program. We will learn a lot about pointers in the process, it will be fun.
